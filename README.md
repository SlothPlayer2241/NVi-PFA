# How to build an apk
First you need to make sure you have the android studio and android-sdk installed.

2) Git clone this repo and cd into it.
3) Set the path to the android sdk in [local.properties](local.properties)
4) Run the build command:
```
./gradlew assembleDebug
```
This only builds the debug version of the apk

There's also an apk file you can download in app/build/outputs/apk/debug/ 

*) If you want to build the desktop version (which is currently available and works best on arch linux atm) check out [the guide build](app/jni/src/README.md) from the core source code of the app.
